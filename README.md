15. Cables

# Apps and Online Services
You only need Arduino IDE.

# Instructions
1. Assemble the whole circuit as seen in the attached schematic.
2. Connect the Arduino Uno with one of your computer's USB port and upload the source code for the receiver.
3. Connect the Arduino Nano with another USB port and upload the source code for the transmitter choosing the new port (be careful not to mix up the ports).
4. The alarm system is ready for use.
